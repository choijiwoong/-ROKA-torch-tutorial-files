#Classification & Regression

#Binary Classification: get True or False
#Multi-class Classification: get n answers
#Regression_continue: get result value

#Supervised Learning: learn with Label(answer)_reducing error value between label and prediction
#Unsupervised Learning: learn without label(objective data)_ex. clustering
#Reinforced Learning: title is text

#Sample: one data or one row in machine learning or one record in Database
#Feature: independant variable x(column in record)

#Confusion Matrix: TP FN FP TN for feedback in accuracy
#Precision=TP/(TP+FP) _TP on returned positive
#Recall=TP/(TP+FN) _TP on real positive

#fitting = The processing of training
#Overtitting: error on training data < error on testing data_ depended by Dropout, Early Stopping, etc..
#Underfitting: error on training data >=< error on testing data
